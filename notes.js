// Creating App for devices within IOS and Android Devices
// Connecting the Device to determine the amount of calories and energy burned from exercise, walking, or any movementor even sleeping patterns
// So to do so I will need to make the app capable of working on IOS 
// Counting the macros from each data entry ✅
// Using an APi to fetch grocery items and their calorie log ✅
// Use the fetched data and add a button if the user chooses to add the item ✅
// The user needs a profile page -- User's Name, age, weight, gender, height, activity level ✅
// Counting the macros from each data entry ✅
// Effects the macro calories for that day, have the user select the current calories from the calorie calculator (Button), these calories will then be deducted based on the calorie log ✅
// Update the food search to allow user to change based on the number of servings or grams ✅
// Ask for tips about how you want to change the website
// AI might be a cool feature
// Lets Develop an Organized Workout List based on the Muscle Group, possibly an icon for each muscle, which the user selects
// Allowed the Users to Select Based on Categories Instead, this allows them to create any split they would like
// Bug when logging an existing template workout it changes the logs to the with the same name to that exact logs info ✅
// If they log the same workout multiple times on the same day it causes an issue as its unable to tell the difference apart. 
// The categories that are created are given to all users, we must change it to specific users ✅
// A bug for the deployed version whenever the user refreshes the app crashes, as in local host it would just go to home 
// Somethings off with calorie log for getting the logs
